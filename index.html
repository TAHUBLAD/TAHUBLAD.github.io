    <h1 class="w3-center">Vaibhav Roychoudhry</h1>
    <p>My name is Vaibhav Roychoudhry. I am an Indian residing in the Emirates of Dubai. I came to this country as a street sweeper with my fellow-laborer comrades. I managed to get a promotion to a car cleaner which is when my fate turned a new page. I found myself entering a whole new world. One that I did not see forthcoming... Amongst the cars that I cleaned, the tires that I scrubbed, and the windows I shined lay something much deeper. I had landed myself into the battlefield of the uber-rich where espionage, laundering, and high-level politics were the grind. I, as a simple Indian man on a miserly wage, managed to build up connections, establish branching partnerships and expand an empire that no one knows the extent of except that they cannot dare to speak about it...
